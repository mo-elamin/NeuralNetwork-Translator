NeuralNetwork Translator

Project Description
The NeuralNetwork Translator is a web-based application that uses neural network models to translate text between different languages. It supports real-time translation with an intuitive frontend built with Flask. The backend leverages Hugging Face's MarianMT models for machine translation.

Features
- Auto Language Detection: Automatically detect the source language using the `langid` library.
- Multi-Language Support: Translate between English, Spanish, French, and German.
- Real-Time Translation: Instant translation with a responsive web interface.
- Extensible Architecture: Easy to add support for more language pairs in the future.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- PyTorch
- `langid` library

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuralNetwork-Translator.git
   cd NeuralNetwork-Translator
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) If you're using GPU for faster performance, install the appropriate PyTorch version with GPU support:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
   ```

Usage
1. Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. Use the interface to select the source and target languages, input a sentence, and click **Translate**.

Future Enhancements
- Asynchronous Translation: Improve performance by handling translations asynchronously to reduce response time.
- More Language Support: Add additional languages using Hugging Face MarianMT models.
- Deploy to Cloud: Consider deploying the application using services like Heroku or AWS for better scalability.
